# Python Fundamentals

## Course Overview

Inspired by [Python.org](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) and [Real Python](https://realpython.com/), the Python Fundamentals course is designed for developers and system administrators who want to get started with Python programming. It is focused on hands-on practice and will help you develop essential skills needed to work effectively with Python for automation, data analysis, web development, and more.

Once you master Python fundamentals, you can explore specialized domains such as: web development with Django/Flask, data science with pandas/numpy, machine learning with scikit-learn, automation with Ansible, cloud programming with AWS/Azure SDKs, and DevOps tooling.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand Python's philosophy, features and ecosystem
- Set up Python development environment with Jupyter notebooks
- Master Python's data model and type system
- Work with fundamental data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)
- Implement control flow with loops and conditionals
- Create and use functions effectively
- Understand object-oriented programming basics in Python
- Work with iterators, generators and comprehensions
- Handle exceptions and debugging techniques
- And much more!

## Who Should Attend

- **Developers** looking to learn Python as an additional language
- **System Administrators** wanting to automate tasks with Python
